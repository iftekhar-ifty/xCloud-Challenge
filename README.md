# AI Collaboration Process

  - Tools used (ChatGpt, Claude)
    - I ask ai multiple question which help me to move fast here some example what i ask & why
    
      - act as a laravel expert i want some suggestion like i am using some code structure on my laravel project . now i want to how is right approach  to scalable ? if not then why? here my structure i follow
repositoryInterface>UserRepository > and controller. and if u have any idea to improve this approach
show me and explain me why its best ? pros and cons . 
      - acta s as inertia expert and react now making a simple pagination at controller i passing data like that
User::paginate(10)
all u have to making a simple tailwindcss system pagination button should text-gray-600
      - i want to optimize this code what i have right now . i ahve doing filter 3 separate methods so what i want i making a dynamic approch so that each of method working perfectly . making a commin function so that i can use future uses as well.
here my code. after generate code explained me why i implement this version. guide me each and every deatils
     const handleSearch = (value) => { 
          const queryParams = new URLSearchParams({
              perPage: 10,
          });
          const filter_fields = Object.keys(filters);
          const filter_values = Object.values(filters);
        
          setSearchQuery(value)
          router.get('/', {
              search_value:value,
              filter_field: filter_fields,
              filter_value: filter_values
          }, { preserveState: true })
      }
      const handleFilterChange = (field, value) => {
          const newFilters = { ...filters, [field]: value }
          setFilters(newFilters)

          const filter_fields = Object.keys(newFilters);
          const filter_values = Object.values(newFilters);

          router.get("/", {
              filter_field: filter_fields,
              filter_value: filter_values
          }, {
              preserveState: true,
              replace: true
          })
      }
      function handlePerPage(value){
          router.get("/", {
              perPage:value
          }, {
              preserveState: true,
              replace: true
          })
      }
      - act as a frontend expert over 5 years . also have UI/UX experience. now i want a table which have multiple headers called name,provider, ram,stoarge action. here some specific requirement i want
        1. at action row u have to show svg icon edit,show, and delete. each one button clickable and when we click it should open a modal.
        2. on top section of table u have to adding search input with button, adding multiple filter like dropdown.  
        3. at table header adding sort button 
        4. and adding a bottom side of table adding simple pagination
        5. for theme color u can adding bg-gray-600 each button

        only generate html file using tailwindcss and for modal open u can adding little bit of alpine js that's it
 
    - What you accepted vs. rewrote

        - for frontend i accept design but change the action button bg color to plan svg icon, change pagination
        - implement service layer with custom messages
    - 

- Debugging Journey
  - No one want their code facing some bugs. sometime debugging journey really frustrating to prevent this i check every data i get from response or passing data on response also use exception with try catch and here i log throw like that $exception->messages and which line i am getting error.For doing this it really easy to debugging 

- Tech decisions & trade-offs
    - for building rest api i use reuseable service layer with repository design it helps me whole application and 
    - for frontend i use react,inertia & laravel 

- Time spent
